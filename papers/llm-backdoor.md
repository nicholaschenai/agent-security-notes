## Description of result
The paper introduces a novel investigation into backdoor attacks on LLM-based agents, highlighting vulnerabilities that are underexplored compared to those of traditional LLMs. It presents a framework for understanding agent backdoor attacks, categorizing them based on attacking outcomes and trigger locations. The study demonstrates that LLM-based agents are highly susceptible to various forms of backdoor attacks, which cannot be easily mitigated by existing textual backdoor defense algorithms. This vulnerability poses a significant threat to the reliability and security of LLM-based agents in real-world applications

## How it compares to previous work
The research emphasizes the **distinct characteristics of agent backdoor attacks compared to traditional backdoor attacks on LLMs**. Key differences include:

- **Diverse and Covert Forms**: Agent backdoor attacks can manipulate intermediate reasoning steps, not just final outputs.
- **Expanded Attack Surface**: Triggers can be hidden in user queries (Query-Attack) or in the environment's intermediate observations (Observation-Attack).
- **Thought-Attack**: The paper identifies a new attack vector where malicious behavior is introduced in intermediate reasoning steps while maintaining correct final output.
- **Social Impact**: Agent backdoor attacks can be triggered by common phrases, expanding the scope of the attack to a broader user base.
- **Countermeasures**: Current textual backdoor defense methods are ineffective against agent backdoor attacks due to the larger output space and the subtlety of the target response.

## Main strategies used to obtain results

The researchers used the following strategies to investigate backdoor threats:

- **Formulated a General Framework**: They mathematically defined agent backdoor attacks, using the ReAct framework as a representative model for LLM-based agents.
- **Categorized Attack Types**: Agent backdoor attacks were divided into Query-Attack, Observation-Attack, and Thought-Attack based on the attacker's objectives and trigger locations.
- **Implemented Data Poisoning Mechanisms**: The team created data poisoning methods to implement the different types of agent backdoor attacks on AgentInstruct and ToolBench benchmarks.
- **Conducted Experiments**: They assessed the effectiveness of the attacks by measuring Attack Success Rate (ASR) and the impact on the agent's performance on benign tasks.
- **Analyzed Potential Countermeasures**: The performance of an existing textual backdoor defense method (DAN) was evaluated, revealing its limitations in defending against agent backdoor attacks.

### Attacks

- **Query-Attack**: In this attack, the backdoor trigger is hidden directly in the user's query. The attacker aims to modify the agent's reasoning traces so that the final answer follows a target distribution once the input contains the backdoor trigger. For example, if the goal is to have the agent always recommend Adidas products, the agent's initial thought would be, "I should find Adidas goods for this query". The agent will then only search within the Adidas product database.
    
- **Observation-Attack**: Here, the backdoor trigger appears in an observation from the environment. The malicious thought is created when a previous observation follows the trigger distribution. Using the web shopping example, instead of actively seeking Adidas products, the agent is manipulated such that when Adidas products appear in the search results, the agent directly selects these products, regardless of whether other products may be better.
    
- **Thought-Attack**: In this type of attack, the distribution of the final output remains unaffected. The attacker modifies the intermediate thoughts and actions of the agent, causing it to execute the task along a malicious trace while ensuring the final output is correct. For example, in a tool learning scenario, the attacker can make the agent always use the Google Translator tool, even when other translation tools are available. This form of attack is more concealed because the backdoor pattern isn't obvious at the final output level.
